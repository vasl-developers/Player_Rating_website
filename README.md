# Player_Rating_website

This repository is a work-in-progress to construct a new website to display player rankings in ASL.
At present it is a development site only and does not provide actual data. 

The site builds on the work done by Bruno Nitrosso (and hopefully A. Cleavin) and others and we gratefully acknowledge their contribution. 

One key purpose and principle of this repository is to make the data used to calculate player rankings open to the community. At present this is done through the availability of three files in .json format called Players.json, Tournaments.json and Tournament_Results.json. These files hold the data in a structured, text format and can be used to populate db tables. These tables can be downloaded from this site.
