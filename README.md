# Player_Rating_website

This is a repository for a new website to display player rankings in ASL.  

The site builds on the work done by Bruno Nitrosso, Aaron Cleavin and others and we gratefully acknowledge their contribution. 

One key purpose and principle of this repository is to make the data used to calculate player rankings open to the community. At present this is done through the availability of .csv These files hold the data in a structured, text format and can be used to populate db tables. These files can be downloaded from this site or the actual site at asl-ratings.org.
