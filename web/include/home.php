      <p>This tool replaces the <a href="http://asl-area.org" target="_blank">AREA rating tool</a> managed by Bruno Nitrosso until 2017. It uses the same tournament-based information and rules algorithm for determining ratings and rankings as did Bruno's AREA. It is a player rating system whose goal is to support ranking/seeding players during tournament play.</p>
