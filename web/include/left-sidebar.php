      <h3>Why a player rating system?</h3>
      <p><i> </i></p>
      <p><i>Many ASL players around the globe participate in tournaments. While tournament formats and player matchup processes vary considerably, many tournaments use a player ranking to determine who plays who.  </i></p>
      <p><i>The ASL Player Rating System, and it's forerunner, AREA, are expressly designed to help tournament managers perform this ranking.</i></p>
      <p><i>The ASL Player Rating System is built on previous work and applications. It uses historical data from past tournaments assembled by Bruno Nitrosso and others, most recently at <a href="http://asl-area.org" target="_blank">asl-area.org</a>. It also uses the same methodology as the AREA site to derive the player ratings.</i></p>
      <p><i>By clicking on the options shown on this page, a Tournament Director or anyone else can see an ordered list of ASL players. </i></p>
      <p><i>Data from xx tournaments has been added to the data curated by Bruno Nitrosso up to 2017.</i></p>
