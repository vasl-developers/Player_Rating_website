      <h3>Why a player rating system?</h3>
      <p><i> </i></p>
      <p><i>Many ASL players around the globe participate in tournaments. While tournament formats and player matchup processes vary considerably, many tournaments use a player ranking to determine who plays who.  </i></p>
      <p><i>The ASL Player Rating System, and it's forerunner, AREA, are expressly designed to help tournament managers perform this ranking.</i></p>
      <p><i>While there are many other things such as system could do to help those who enjoy playing ASL, this current tool is not designed to meet those needs.</i></p>
      <p><i>The ASL Player Rating System is built on previous work and applications. It uses historical data from past tournaments assembled by Bruno Nitrosso and others, most recently at <a href="http://asl-area.org" target="_blank">asl-area.org</a>. It also uses the same methodology as this site to derive the player ratings.</i></p>
      <p><i>By clicking on the options shown on this page, a Tournament Director, or anyone else can see an ordered list of ASL players. </i></p>
      <p><i>Data from xx tournaments has been added to the data curated by Bruno Nitrosso up to 2017.</i></p>

            <p>Welcome to the ASL Player Rating System. This tool replaces the AREA rating tool managed by Bruno Nitrosso until 2017 (which in turn stood on the shoulders of giants. See About AREA). While presenting a different interface it uses the same tournament-based information and rules algorithm for determining ratings and rankings as did Bruno's AREA. It is a player rating system whose goal is to support ranking/seeding players during tournament play. </p>

            <p>The above represents the core functionality of the ASL Player Rating System and is the central part of its mandate. Additional functionality (such as viewing Tournament-by-Tournament results) may be added over time</p>
